## Method
1. Pre-heat the oven to 200C
1. Put the frozen pastry sheets on the bench to thaw
1. Slice the bacon up into little bits about ½ cm by 3cm
1. Grate the cheese (it tastes better than the pre shredded stuff)
1. Prepare the oniony stuff
1. Thinly slice the tomato (it’s easier if you cut the tomato in half vertically then slice it cut side down, It is more stable and the slices don’t squish as you cut them)

### Now
1. Line the pie dish with the thawed (but not too floppy) pastry
1. Trim off overhanging bits and use them to fill in the missing bits
1. Layer the ingredients: bacon, cheese, onion, lightly forked eggs, tomato
1. Put the lid on.
1. Goonk, goonk, goonk the edges with a fork to seal the pastry
1. Zip around the edges with a knife to trim excess pastry. You can use the scrags to decorate the top… or toss them
1. Lightly score the top with a cross hatch pattern and stab a few air holes, especially a good sized one in the centre
1. Glaze the top with the leftover egg (it makes the top nice and brown and shiny)
1. Sprinkle a little bit of extra cheese on the top if you like but not too much

### Finally
1. Put the pie in the oven on 200 for about 10 minutes, then lower the temp to 180 for about 30 minutes or until it looks nicely puffed up and browned
1. Let it sit for about 20 minutes before you cut it
