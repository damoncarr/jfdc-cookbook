      - 1 1/4 cups sugar
      - 3 eggs
      - 1/2 tsp vanilla essence
      - 1 1/2 cups plain flour
      - 1/2 tsp baking powder
      - 1/2 cup milk
      - 1/2 cup raspberry jam (optional)
      - 1 cup coconut flakes

      - 1/2 cup hot water
      - 1 tbsp unsalted butter
      - 2 tbsp dutch cocoa
      - 3 cups pure icing sugar, sifted

notes: Take all the best bits of the lamington and turn them into a cupcake. I have used a basic butter cake recipe here. If you like raspberry jam, add a dollop in the middle of these before you ice them. The coconut flakes are rather fancy, but you could easily use desiccated coconut.

## Method
1. Preheat oven to 180 deg.
1. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla and mix well. Sift flour with baking powder and mix in alternately with milk.
1. Place spoonfuls in lined muffin tins and bake in oven for 20 minutes, until lightly browned and cooked when tested with a skewer.
1. Remove and cool on wire racks.
1. When cool, scoop a small piece of cake from out of the top and place a spoonful of raspberry jam.

### Chocolate icing
1. Combine hot water, butter and cocoa and whisk until smooth. Add to icing sugar and mix well until it is the desired consistency. (Add a little more icing sugar to thicken, or more hot water if it is too thick.)
1. Ice the cooled cakes, spoon a little extra jam in the middle and sprinkle over the coconut flakes to garnish.
