## Method
1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 23cm (base) frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until softened. Add garlic, cumin, paprika and oregano. Cook for 30 seconds or until fragrant. Add mince. Cook, breaking up mince with a wooden spoon, for 5 minutes or until browned all over.
2. Add tomato paste and 1/4 cup water. Stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Add beans. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Stir in chilli and coriander. Transfer to a bowl. Set aside for 15 minutes to cool.
3. Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan-forced. Wipe frying pan clean. Drizzle with remaining oil.
4. Place 1 tortilla on a board. Spread with 1/4 cup sour cream. Top with 1/3 cup mince mixture and sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese. Roll up tortilla tightly. Trim and discard ends. Cut into 4 equal lengths. Arrange rolls, upright, around edge of pan, sitting snugly. Repeat with remaining tortillas, sour cream, mince mixture and cheese, to create 2 rings, leaving a hole in the centre. Sprinkle tortillas with remaining cheese.
5. Combine salsa and peppers in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon into centre of frying pan. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until tortillas are golden and cheese is melted. Stand for 5 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, make Guacamole Place avocado and lime juice in a bowl. Using a fork, mash until smooth. Season well with salt and pepper. Stir in coriander.
7. Serve pull-apart with guacamole, tomato, extra sour cream, chilli and coriander.
