### Method
Combine stock and wine in a medium saucepan; bring to boil, then simmer. Meanwhile, heat margarine and oil in a large saucepan; cook both onion, spring onions, and garlic stirring until onion softens. Add rice, stir to coat in oil mixture. Stir in one cup of hot stock mixture and cook, stirring over low heat until liquid is fully absorbed. Continue adding stock mixture in one cup batches, stirring until absorbed between each addition. Total cooking time should be about 35 minutes or until rice is tender.

Gently stir in prawns and allow to cook for two minutes. Stir in asparagus, snow peas, sugar snap peas, chives and cheese. When combined stir through the lemon juice.

Stand covered for five minutes.

Sprinkle risotto with extra chives.
