## Method
1. Heat stock in a saucepan on medium heat until almost simmering. Reduce heat to low.
2. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large heavy based pan over medium heat. Add leek and cook for about 2 minutes or until soft. Add the rice and stir until well coated with oil.
3. Add a ladleful of the heated stock, stirring until the liquid is almost absorbed. Continue the process, adding a ladleful of stock at a time until all the stock has been added and the rice is just cooked. This should take about 15-20 minutes. Place lid on risotto, and set aside.
4. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a frying pan over high heat. Add the prawns and cook for about 2 minutes, turning once until just cooked. Add wine and cook for 1 minute or until wine has reduced by 1/2. Add cherry tomatoes, basil and cream and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the cream has thickened slightly.
5. Gently stir the prawn mixture into the risotto. Garnish with extra basil leaves if desired.
